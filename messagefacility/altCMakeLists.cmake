# Handle installation of headers and support files here, as the current
# structure of MF is awkward (and appears to only be so for legacy reasons)
# - Awkwardnesses are:
#   - Utilities built seperately, but no need to do so
#   - MF_MessageLogger built in MessageLogger, but uses sources from
#     MessageService
#   - EldestinationTester in MessageService, but not part of Library

# Install directory for headers - do this way and here as we don't have
# optional headers so no filtering/selection required, except
# that we need to exclude several cruft directories
